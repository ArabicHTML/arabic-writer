This project was my contribution in the first arabteam2000-forum programming contests.

It's intended to aid in writing short Arabic phrases (which potentially could include english words, i.e. bidirectional phrases) into programs that don't support proper rendering/shaping of Arabic text, such as the non-ME version of Photoshop, and Flash.
